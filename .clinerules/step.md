# Component Development Guidelines

## Overview

When adding new components, I will provide you with Vue 3 code. You must strictly follow Vue 3 standards when adding or modifying components, ensuring all functionality remains consistent.

## Development Process

### Step 1: Component Implementation

- Add or modify component files in `packages/core/src/components/xxx`
- Ensure full compliance with the provided Vue 3 code
- Maintain all functionality as specified in the original code

### Step 2: Demo Development

- Create modular demonstration examples based on your implemented components
- Place all demos in the `demo` directory
- Implement a sidebar navigation structure for easy access to different demos
- Ensure demos showcase all key component features and variations

### Step 3: Documentation

- Develop comprehensive documentation for the component in `docs`
- Include:
  - Detailed component description
  - Complete API reference (props, events, slots, methods)
  - Usage examples with code snippets
  - Best practices and common use cases
  - Any relevant notes or warnings

## Quality Standards

- All code must be properly formatted and follow project conventions
- Components should be thoroughly tested before submission
- Documentation must be clear, concise, and helpful for end users
